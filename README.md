# Huzzah!
### Goal
Provide distance measurement, temperature, humidity, and alerting for a [feather huzzah with Wifi](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2821) using [CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/overview).
### Real Goal
Have a whole house humidifier at home. 
I keep forgetting to refill the damn thing with water. 
It uses about 2 gallons of water a day during dry months, and runs dry constantly.
It also is very poor at detecting the humidity. 
Maybe because the sensor is built into the unit and therefore is too close to get a realistic sample?
Also want to be able to read settings (like water level) from the humidifier and be able to remotely start and stop it.
So let's use some machine learning and alerting as goals. 
Also the fan on the humidifier has a variable speed fan, so let's play with that as well.
Also, to save my sanity and probably marriage....it has to be cheap AND as is the usual on all my home projects...
manual control has to be enabled and take priority.
That's enough for now.
